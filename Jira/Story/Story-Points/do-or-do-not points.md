When it comes to estimating **story points** in Jira, there are some best practices—**do’s**—and common pitfalls—**don’ts**—that can help your team improve their estimation process. Following these will lead to more consistent, accurate estimates and better sprint planning.

### **Do’s of Estimating Story Points**

1. **Do Use Relative Sizing**
   - Estimating in **relative terms** (comparing one story to another) is more effective than absolute estimates. Don't focus on how long a task will take in hours or days; focus on how complex it is compared to others. 
   - Use a **reference story** that is well understood and agreed upon by the team as a baseline.

2. **Do Involve the Whole Team**
   - Involve everyone in the team, including developers, testers, and product owners, in the estimation process. This helps ensure that all aspects (e.g., technical, business, testing) are considered.
   - Different perspectives will lead to more balanced and realistic estimates.

3. **Do Use Planning Poker or Similar Techniques**
   - **Planning Poker** is a popular method where each team member assigns their estimate privately and then they discuss the differences.
   - This helps avoid bias and encourages everyone to contribute their thoughts on the task, which leads to more accurate estimates.

4. **Do Estimate Based on Complexity and Effort**
   - Focus on the **complexity** and **effort** involved in a task. Consider factors like unknowns, dependencies, and how hard it will be to complete the task rather than the time it will take.
   - If you are unsure, assign a higher number of points as a buffer to account for uncertainty.

5. **Do Break Large Stories into Smaller Tasks**
   - Large, complex tasks should be broken down into smaller, more manageable **user stories**. It's easier to estimate small tasks, and it allows for better tracking and progress in the sprint.
   - Use the **INVEST** criteria to ensure your stories are well-defined and small enough to fit within a sprint (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).

6. **Do Use Historical Data and Velocity for Guidance**
   - Use your team’s **historical velocity** (the average number of story points completed per sprint) to guide your estimates.
   - Look at past stories with similar complexity and size to understand how many points your team typically assigns to tasks of that nature.

7. **Do Communicate Assumptions and Dependencies**
   - Clearly communicate any assumptions you're making while estimating a task. If you're unsure about something, flag it with the team. 
   - Similarly, identify any **dependencies** early (e.g., other tasks or teams), as they can influence both effort and complexity.

8. **Do Review Estimates Regularly**
   - Regularly review your estimation process, particularly after completing a sprint. Did you finish more or fewer story points than planned? Did some estimates turn out to be inaccurate?
   - Use retrospectives to discuss estimation accuracy and adjust your approach if needed.

### **Don’ts of Estimating Story Points**

1. **Don’t Estimate in Hours or Days**
   - Story points are **not** about estimating how much time a task will take. Avoid using hours or days as a measure. Estimating in time can lead to pressure and unrealistic expectations.
   - Time-based estimates often lead to problems such as misinterpretation, unrealistic deadlines, or pressure to complete tasks faster.

2. **Don’t Allow Single Person Domination**
   - While it's okay to have a **facilitator** guiding the estimation process, ensure that **all team members** contribute their thoughts. A single person dominating the conversation can lead to inaccurate or biased estimates.
   - Encourage everyone to speak up, especially if they feel a story is being underestimated or overestimated.

3. **Don’t Overthink or Get Stuck on Details**
   - Avoid getting bogged down in **micromanaging details** when estimating. Remember that the goal of story points is to provide a **relative estimate**, not an exact figure.
   - It’s better to move forward with an estimate and adjust later than to keep revising over trivial details.

4. **Don’t Treat Story Points as a Deadline or a Commitment**
   - **Story points are an estimate, not a promise**. Don’t treat story points as a guarantee of how much work will be completed. Many variables (e.g., unforeseen challenges or external blockers) can affect the final outcome.
   - Focus on using story points to gauge **effort and complexity**, not as a strict measure of when or if the task will be completed.

5. **Don’t Compare Different Teams**
   - Each team has its own context, speed, and capacity. Don’t compare the story points assigned by your team with another team’s estimates. Even if two teams use the same scale, their capacity and context might be different.
   - Focus on **your team’s historical performance** and **context** rather than trying to match estimates with other teams.

6. **Don’t Assign Points to Non-User Stories (Like Bugs) Without Context**
   - While it’s common to assign story points to user stories, **bugs** and **technical debt** should be estimated carefully.
   - Make sure you understand the **effort and complexity** involved in fixing the bug or handling the technical debt. It’s important to evaluate if the bug is related to existing code or if it involves significant rework, which may require higher story points.

7. **Don’t Ignore Dependencies or Unknowns**
   - If a story has unknowns (e.g., reliance on another team or new technology), don’t ignore them. These factors increase the **risk** and **uncertainty**, which should be reflected in the story point estimation.
   - Make sure to document **dependencies**, **risks**, and **assumptions**, so everyone is aware of potential blockers.

8. **Don’t Let Story Points Become a Scorecard for Performance**
   - Story points should **not** be used to evaluate individual performance. They are a tool for team planning and collaboration. Focusing on how many points an individual completes can lead to unhealthy competition or discourage collaboration.
   - Use story points for **sprint planning**, **workload distribution**, and **predictability**, not for performance reviews.

9. **Don’t Forget to Consider Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**
   - Non-functional requirements like **performance**, **scalability**, **security**, and **accessibility** can significantly impact the complexity and effort of a story. Don’t neglect these factors during estimation.
   - If a story includes significant NFRs, ensure they are factored into the estimation, as these often require more work than initially apparent.

#### **Do’s**:
- Use **relative sizing** to estimate complexity.
- Involve the **whole team** in the estimation process.
- Use techniques like **Planning Poker** to avoid bias.
- Focus on **effort, complexity**, and **uncertainty**.
- Break down large stories into smaller, more manageable tasks.
- Use **historical data** and **velocity** as guidance.
- Communicate assumptions, dependencies, and risks.
- Review estimates regularly for continuous improvement.

#### **Don’ts**:
- Don’t estimate in **hours or days**.
- Don’t let a single person dominate the estimation.
- Don’t **overthink** or get stuck on small details.
